# StealthStalker

This was my first real/big c++ project. Keep in mind it isn’t complete and might not be working in some weird and rare cases but as far as I have tested it never failed.
Ok, so feature list? yeah sure. It doesn’t have too much of them, currently it will steal:

    Skype chat logs and saves them into a HTML file for better viewing
    Internet Explorer browsing history (read below for details)
    Opera browsing history
    Firefox browsing history
    Chrome browsing history
    Uploads data to a remote server
    Saves data locally – can be run from flash drive

When the data is stolen it will be written to a folder structure like so: CURRENT_USER/DATE-TIME/*
